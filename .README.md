## Types of Components

In React, components can be defined as either class components or functional components.

- JSX Expressions must have one parent element

- You can use `<React.Fragment>` as the parent instead of `<div>` if you want to avoid adding an extra wrapper element in the HTML structure.

### Class Component

Class components are defined as JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

### Functional Component

Functional components are defined as JavaScript functions

```js
import React from 'react';

const HelloWorld = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

export default HelloWorld;
```

## Imports & Exports

`Note that import and export are part of the ECMAScript (ES) module system, which is supported in modern JavaScript environments like Node.js and most modern browsers. However, in older JavaScript environments or when using CommonJS modules (e.g., in Node.js before version 14), you may need to use require() and module.exports for module functionality.`

### Export

**export** is used to expose code from a module that can be used by other modules. It can be used in various forms:

#### 1. Default Export

This syntax exports a default value from a module. It can be a function, class, or variable. Only one default export is allowed per module.

```js
export default myFunc;
```

```js
export default MyClass;
```

```js
export default variable;
```

#### 2. Named Exports

This syntax exports specific values or entities from a module. Each named export is explicitly defined and can be imported individually.

```js
export const myFunc = () => {
  /* function body */
};
export class MyClass {
  /* class definition */
}
export const variable = 42;
```

#### 3. Renamed Exports

This syntax allows you to rename exports while exporting them. It creates aliases for the exported values, so they can be imported using different names.

```js
export { myFunc as func, MyClass as CustomClass };
```

### Import

On the other hand, **import** is used to bring exported values from other modules into the current module. It can also be used in various ways:

#### 1. Importing a Default Export

This syntax imports the default export from the specified module.

```js
import myFunction from './module';
```

```js
import MyClass from './module';
```

```js
import variable from './module';
```

#### 2. Importing Named Exports

This syntax imports specific named exports from the specified module. The names used in the import statement must match the exported names.

```js
import { myFunc, MyClass, variable } from './module';
```

#### 3. Importing with Renamed Exports

This syntax imports named exports with renamed aliases.

```js
import { func as myFunc, CustomClass as MyClass } from './module';
```

## JSX

### Rules for creating a component in JSX

1. **Use a single parent element:** Each component should have one wrapping element that contains all the child elements and content.

2. **Capitalize component names:** Always start the component names with a capital letter. This distinguishes them from regular HTML elements.

3. **Use self-closing tags for empty elements:** If a component doesn't have any content or children, use a self-closing tag, like `<MyComponent />`.

4. **Close tags properly:** All HTML tags in JSX must be closed either with a closing tag (`</tag>`) or a self-closing tag (`<tag />`).

5. **Embed JavaScript expressions with curly braces:** To include JavaScript expressions within JSX, wrap them in curly braces {}. This allows dynamic content or variable usage within the JSX structure.

6. **Choose between class components and function components:** You can create components using either class components (extending React.Component) or function components (using plain JavaScript functions).
